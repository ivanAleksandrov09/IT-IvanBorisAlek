        <h1>Fighter jets</h1>
        <p>Fighter aircraft are military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat. In military conflict, the
          role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. Domination of the airspace above
          a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage intactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets.
          The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and
          maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air
          superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its
          doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.
          Many modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as
          fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized
          while still filling the main air superiority role, and these include the interceptor, heavy fighter, and night
          fighter.</p>
